    "### From Linear to Deep Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Beyond Linear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models can be fit efficiently via convex optimization, but the model capacity is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative:\n",
    "$$ f(x) = w^T\\phi(x) $$\n",
    "where $\\phi$ is a *non-linear transform*\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine-learning model transforms its input data into meaningful outputs, a process that is \"learned\" from exposure to known examples of inputs and outputs. Therefore, _**the central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully transform data**_: in other words, to learn useful *representations* of the input data at hand -- representations that get us closer to the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to use a very generic $\\phi$. If $\\phi(x)$ is of high enough dimension, we can always have enough capacity to fit the training set, but generalization to the test set often remains poor. Very generic feature mappings are usually based only on the principle of local smoothness and do not encode enough prior information to solve advanced problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to manually engineer $\\phi$. Until the advent of deep learning, this was the dominant approach. It requires decades of human effort for each separate task, with practitioners specializing in different domains, such as speech recognition or computer vision, and with little transfer between domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly learn $\\phi$ with parameters $\\theta$, specifically:\n",
    "$$f(x;\\theta) = w^T\\phi(x;\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have parameters $\\theta$ that we use to learn $\\phi$ from a broad class of functions, and parameters that map from $\\phi(x)$ to the desired output. This is an example of a deep feed-forward network, with $\\phi$ defining a hidden layer. This approach is the only one of the three that gives up on the convexity of the training problem, but the benefits outweigh the harms. In this approach, we parametrize the representation as $\\phi(x;\\theta)$ and use the optimization algorithm to find the $\\theta$ that corresponds to a good representation. If we wish, this approach can capture the benefit of the first approach by being highly generic$-$we do so by using a very broad family $\\phi(x;\\theta)$. Deep learning can also capture the benefit of the second approach. Human practitioners can encode their knowledge to help generalization by designing families $\\phi(x;\\theta)$ that they expect will perform well. The advantage is that the human designer only needs to find the right general function family rather than finding precisely the right function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![layers of representations](representations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *deep* in *deep learning* isn't a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by the approach; rather, it stands for this idea of successive layers of representations. How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the *depth* of the model. Other appropriate names for the field could have been *layered representations learning* and *hierarchical representations learning*. Modern deep learning often involves tens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations$-$and they're all learned automatically from exposure to training data."

This is necessary in order to determine the distance between the algorithm's current output and its expected output.

It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the 1980s. *You can think of \"solving\" MNIST as the \"Hello World\" of deep learning* -- it's what you do to verify that your algorithms are working as expected.

    "Time permitting, it is also enlightening to analyze loss and accuracy when the activation parameter is modified. For instance, try changing `relu`s for `sigmoid`s and check out the performance of the neural network. What happen if the output layer's activation function is not `softmax` but a `sigmoid`?"
